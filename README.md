# 👻 PetraType Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! 
A space to showcase my coding experiments and projects.  

I build small projects using **Python** and **JavaScript**, applying what I’m learning and gradually developing each idea. These projects are works-in-progress exercises aimed at improving my skills. This portfolio provides a single, accessible place for anyone — including potential employers — to explore them.
