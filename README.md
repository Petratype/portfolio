# 👻 PetraType Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a space for all my playful and creative code experiments.

I like building weird, tiny things that mix **Python**, **JavaScript**, and a bit of atmosphere to make it fun and personalized.  
Every project below reflects something I wanted to learn, feel or summon 🕯️✨
Looking forward to apply on a professional experience.

## 🖤 About Me
I’m Petra — a creative junior coder exploring the overlap between **tech, art, and functionality**.  

Right now I’m learning Data Science and web development. I develop small, simple projects that can grow in complexity as I continue learning. While studying, I focus on creating interactive experiences and web applications that align with the skills and tools sought in the job market, such as chatbots, web pages, and small games. My portfolio showcases the projects I’m currently working on, serving as a single, accessible place for people — and potential employers — to explore them. These projects are works-in-progress, exercises to develop my coding skills, and I continually refine and expand them over time.
